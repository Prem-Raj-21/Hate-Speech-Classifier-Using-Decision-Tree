# Hate-Speech-Classifier-Using-Decision-Tree

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect hate speech in tweets using a decision tree classifier. Hate speech is a significant issue on social media platforms, and automated detection can help in moderating content and creating a safer online environment. We use a dataset from Kaggle that contains labeled tweets to train our model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset" available on Kaggle. You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset).
